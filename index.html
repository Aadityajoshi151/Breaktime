        <h1>Breaktime - Take a Break ‚è∞</h1><br>
        <p>A simple desktop app that reminds you to take a small break after every hour.</p><br>
        <p>When dissolved in work, we often forget that our body needs some rest.</p><br>

        <p>Being a programmer, I am mostly in front of a screen. A while ago, I started to experience headaches, eyestrain, and some problems in my neck. The doctor advised me to take breaks while working but when I am doing my work, I hardly remember to get up. After months of NOT follwing his advise and the problem worsening, I decided to make this app for myself. Since this app can be useful to almost all people, I decided to make a better version and put it online. I also developed an app to reduce strain on the eyes. You can check it out <a href="https://aadityajoshi151.github.io/Blue-Light-Filter/" target="_blank">here</a>. Our health be it mental or physical, should be our #1 priority. I hope this app, increases your overall health and productivity.</p>

        <p>The app is designed to run at startup so after launching the app once (just after the installation) will add itself to the registry. The reminder window is "sticky", that means once a reminder is displayed, you cannot move/resize/minimize it. There is a snooze button that will make it go away for 5 minutes. When you get up, press the "I am up" button which will make the reminder come again after 1 hour. If you find it annoying, you can always close the app from the system tray. If you decide to uninstall the app, you can do that easily from the control panel as you do for all other apps. It's optional but after uninstalling, you can remove the Breaktime value from the registry editor (HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run) for a thorough uninstallation.</p>
